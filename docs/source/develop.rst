Development Guide
======================

Some general guidelines regarding development in esmlab for maintainers
and contributors. Nothing here is set in stone and can't be changed.
Feel free to suggest improvements or changes in the workflow.

Code Style
-----------

For style we use black, isort, and flake8. These are available as pre-commit
hooks that will run every time you are about to commit code.

From the root directory of `esmlab` project run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install


Branches (TODO)

Issues (TODO)

Release procedure (TODO)
